### Problems and Learning

> While working through this assignment, I had to look through past assignments to create many of teh functions.
For starts, I used teh 3rd assignment as a base for the overall look and style of the project and i used some examples
in the office hours for teh 5th assignment in order to get the multiple pages working in react.

> I was unable to get the footer to stay at the bottom of the page for contacts when in mobile display size.
However, I found that set the position as absolute it would work for that page but be in the middle of pages for others.

### Above and Beyond

> I found an example online to create a contact form in react, this linked to my email to send an actual message to me.

> I found some examples of css to create a timeline for my skills page.

> I used the first assignment and some examples online in order to create dom manipulation when clicking on a projects image.
